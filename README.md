<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>


Step 1: Log into Azure --> search "virtual machines" --> click "create azure virtual machine" to create VM#1. Name this first virtual machine "DC-1" using your current region --> set the image type as "Windows Server 2022" (effectively making it a domain for the lab) --> Set username and password --> create VM #2 --> title it "Client-1" (repeat the same steps used to create VM#1 except for the image type select "Windows 10 pro" since this VM will be the employees'/ cleints' computer).</p>

<p>
Step 2: Go to DC-1's network settings --> select networking --> click the hyperlink next to "network interface" --> "IP Configurations" --> "ipconfig1" --> change the assignment from dynamic to static (this ensures DC-1's IP address will not change) --> check the NIC settings to make sure both VMs are on the same "Vnet". This will ensure both VMs can communicate & connect with each other later in this lab.</p>

</p>
<p>
Step 3: Remote Desktop into DC-1 via windows firwall security settings --> Advanced settings --> inbound/outbound rules to allow "IPV4 permissions" on DC-1's Firewall. This will open the firewall for connectivity after DC-1 is converted into a domain.</p>
